# Oil-Water

**Compile command:** g++ Main.cpp

A dynamical process known as *invasion percolation* has been used to model the shape of the oil-water interface that occurs when water is forced into a porous medium containing oil. The goal is to use the water to recover as much oil as possible. In this process a water cluster grows into the oil through the path of least resistance.
